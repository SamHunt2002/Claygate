									<h1>The In-Between<br /></h1>
									<h4> By Alexander Perez. Directed by Niamh Callan.</h4>
									<p>The In-Between is a fragmented look at what happens just outside the pivotal moments that string our days together and how they define our connection to one another. A dying romance, the start of a family, and Ill-considered medical procedures. The devil’s in the details.</p>

								<p>Pelmear are proud to announce the theatrical debut of The In-Between, at the Drayton Arms Theatre. Casting is to be announced, so keep an eye out!</p>
